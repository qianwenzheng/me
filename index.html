          <p>I grew up in Jamaica for most of my life and I enjoy sunshine, spicy food, and ocean views because they remind me of home. Some little things that never fail to make my day are encounters with dogs, city lights, Buzzfeed quizzes, and a warm cup of green
            tea. Above all these defining features, I aspire to create and to touch the lives of others with my work. In college, I found my creative medium in computer science. Whether it’s writing code that enhances performance in machines or changes
            the way users interact with technology, programming gives me the potential to have an impact on people across the globe.</p>

          <p>I conducted research with Prof. Tom Murtagh to help design and implement a log-structured file system for NAND memory. Our goal was to decrease the number of erasures to increase the longevity of the physical memory. I worked with another student
            research assistant to implement key functions and infrastructure including a library consisting of a virtual NAND memory and a tool to initialize the file system. I also conducted a poster presentation about the research to students, faculty,
            and visitors at a public session on campus. <a href="nandresearch.pdf">view poster for more details</a></p>

          <p>This was a project for a Hackathon at Amherst College. I worked with a team to build a web platform to monitor police audio streamed online from a specific area for keywords/phrases chosen by the user. We wanted to create a tool that could help
            increase people’s awareness of suspicious activities happening around them in order to stay safe. College students could enter the names of campuses or dorms they care about, and if those words were mentioned in current police communication,
            our application would send them an email with the relevant police audio transcriptions. My primary role was building the back end with Flask and integrating Google’s Cloud Speech API for transcribing audio to text that we could parse into
            our program. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/campusear">See more</a></p>

          <p>This project was aimed at attaining deeper insight on machine language and computer organization by building a virtual assembly interpreter to run any program written in an ARM based assembly language using an Intel x86-64 based simulator we
            developed. The project involved implementing all the possible functions that a program could have, including storing and decoding input and executing instructions, and optimizing in terms of speed and memory footprint. We sought to balance
            speed and size so we often had to come up with unorthodox solutions to maintain both a low run time and memory footprint. Here is a <a href="WaveDemo.m4v">demo</a> of a program called "jumper" being run first with the original ARM based instructions, and then with the interpreter.</p>

          <p>This is a semester-long <a href="https://effectivegiving.github.io/">group project</a> that covers all phases of the user experience design lifecycle, including exploring a design space, generating and refining design concepts, gathering user
            data, and producing interactive prototypes. I worked in a team of three to develop a design for a mobile application that lets users make informed donations to effective charities based on their preferences and convenience. My role involved
            carrying out contextual inquiries, analyzing user data through affinity diagramming, designing the product logo, creating the paper prototypes, developing the interface design, and communicating design concepts through storyboarding, prototyping,
            written reports, and oral presentations.</p>

          <p>To explore test-driven development, Wordoku is a puzzle I wrote using Java. It is similar in concept to Sudoku on a 4x4 board, only the objective is to get the four given distinct letters on each row, column, diagonal, and 2x2 grid, as well as spell out a valid English word on the main diagonal. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/qianwenzheng/Wordoku">source code</a> and a <a href="WordokuDemo.m4v">demo</a> of the game. It includes functionality such as receiving hints, clearing the board, and generating a new board. Using a PIT Mutation testing tool for assessment, I achieved line coverage of 99% and mutation coverage of 91%. Here are the mutation test <a href="wordokupittestresults.pdf">results</a>.</p>

          <p>This allows you to populate your browser window with a custom collection of tabs of specific websites, based on what you want to do. For instance, you could have a collection named “Studying”, and you could customize it to load websites such as Google Docs and Quizlet each time you click on it. You can add new collections, delete existing ones, and edit tab collections’ names and their associated URLs.

          <p>I worked on an automated documentation system for IHMC's (Institute for Human & Machine Cognition) open source robotics software. This included building their <a href="https://ihmcrobotics.github.io/">website</a> and using tools such as Bash, Javascript, Gradle, and Bamboo to create automated tasks for publishing webpages, generating and styling corresponding javadocs for their software, versioning documentation, and having stylized code snippets on documentation webpages reflect changes to corresponding updated source code without manual editing. This system also includes an error checking script that assesses the validity of code snippets on webpages in the case that automatic integration with source code fails, triggering Bamboo build failures if there is at least one error.</p>
